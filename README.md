# CS50-C-Exercises
All the CS50 2018 exercises written in the C Programming Language

#### Info

The first code I ever wrote which taught me about data types, condtionals, for loops, functions, Big O notations, sorting algorithms and memory/pointers. Exercises are from the 2018 iteration of HarvardX's online course CS50, which I took from November 2018 to March 2019. 

I found the course to be an excellent introduction to computer science in general. Covering everything from basic algorithms and computational thinking to basic web development.

#### Caveat

Unfortunately many of these cannot be compiled because they include a library specifically built for the course that I no longer have acccess to. Still, it is a useful reference to look back on for C syntax and basics.
